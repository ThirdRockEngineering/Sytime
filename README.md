## Description

Sytime is decentralised chat application. It is required for all users to connect to our Dapp only with Ethereum wallet, such as Metamask. In our Dapp user can create and edit personal account with name, pfp and "about me" section. User can chat with others in different rooms and view the history of each room. User can send images to chat as well! And user can connect with others and create room for personal conversation. Also the list of rooms will be stored in personal account info, so user is able to see all rooms even after starting new browser session.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
